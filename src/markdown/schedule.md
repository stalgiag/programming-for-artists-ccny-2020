<div class = "class-schedule-details">

#### During Class
- Introductions
- Course Overview
- Programming for Artists Overview Lecture
- Overview of Tools for Semester Work
- Tutorial on Drawing & Coordinate System

#### Before Next Class
- Start an [are.na](https://www.are.na/) account
  - This is where you will keep your sketchbook for the course

- Read [Coordinate System and Shapes](https://p5js.org/learn/coordinate-system-and-shapes.html)
- Follow Along with Coding Train Videos:
  - [Shapes and Drawing](https://thecodingtrain.com/beginners/p5js/1.3-shapes-and-drawing.html)
  - [Color](https://thecodingtrain.com/beginners/p5js/1.4-color.html)
  - [Code Comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJcrPJuem5Q)

- Create a still life (assignment adapted by Laurel Schwulst)
  - Assemble a still-life in your workspace
  - This can be an arrangement of a few simple objects, anything is okay
  - Try to "draw" the still life using what you learned in class and by watching the videos
  - Don't worry about details. The goal isn't to spend a ton of time writing hundreds of lines of code but instead to find large shapes and think about the computer as also space of 'flattening' in much the same way as drawing.
  - Feel free to explore other drawing functions in the `2D Primitives` section of [the reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)
  - After you have finished, go to `File->Share` and copy the 'Present' link; make a new block in the class are.na inside of the 'Still Life' channel, add your 'Present' link as the block
