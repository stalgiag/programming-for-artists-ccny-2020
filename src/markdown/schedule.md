  - This can be an arrangement of a few simple objects, anything is okay
  - Try to "draw" the still life in p5.js using what you learned in class and by watching the videos
  - Don't worry about details. The goal isn't to spend a ton of time writing hundreds of lines of code but instead to find large shapes and think about the computer as also space of 'flattening' in much the same way as drawing.
  - Feel free to explore other drawing functions in the `2D Primitives` section of [the reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)
  - After you have finished, go to `File->Share` and copy the 'Present' link; go to the class are.na channel and navigate into the 'Still Life' sub-channel, add your 'Present' link as new block
