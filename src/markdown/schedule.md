  - Assemble a still-life in your workspace
  - This can be an arrangement of a few simple objects, anything is okay
  - Try to "draw" the still life in p5.js using what you learned in class and by watching the videos
  - Don't worry about details. The goal isn't to spend a ton of time writing hundreds of lines of code but instead to find large shapes and think about the computer as also space of 'flattening' in much the same way as drawing.
  - Feel free to explore other drawing functions in the `2D Primitives` section of [the reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)
  - After you have finished, go to `File->Share` and copy the 'Present' link; go to the class are.na channel and navigate into the 'Still Life' sub-channel, add your 'Present' link as new block

  - Pick 1 Word (Any word that you want to make a design for)
  - Use [textToPoints()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Font/textToPoints) to turn your word into an array of points (x, y).
  - Loop over your array of points and draw. This is the opportunity to experiment.
  - Your sketch can be interactive or it can animate or it can be still. You should be looking for ways to draw type in unexpected ways. Bonus points if the relationship between your word choice and design decisions is clear.

- Create and Upload Exercise 7: Relational Systems
  - Design a visual system that generates many clones of the same visual object
  - This visual object should be derived from a class
  - The visual objects can appear on load or  can be spawned by mousePressed()
  - Make each clone communicate with all others. The last tutorials above are especially useful for this.
  - Each object can have an appearance or behavior that changes based on its neighbors (proximity measured with `dist()` is a great place to start)
  - Check out examples

#### During Class
- Look at Exercises
- Tutorial on HTML and DOM
- Tutorial on Alternative Development Environments

#### Before Next Class
- Watch first 3 [Coding Train HTML/CSS/DOM videos](https://thecodingtrain.com/Tutorials/8-html-css-dom/)

- Create and Upload Exercise 8: Scrolling, Unfolding
  - Add a series of HTML `<img>` and `<p>` elements to your sketch
  - You can do this using [p5 DOM functions](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-DOM) or by adding directly to your index.html file
  - Choose the sequence and pacing of these images and or text elements wisely. Tell a story, explore an unfolding rhythm, make something evolve over time; the options, like the scroll, can be endless.
  - Make your canvas full `windowWidth` and `windowHeight` and give it the `position: fixed` style. Look at the template in the are.na channel for hints.
  - Make your sketch change when a user scrolls `mouseWheel()`. You can access the current scroll amount with `window.scrollY`
  - The changes and animations in your canvas should relate to the sequence of images that viewers see as they scroll.
  - Get Inspired

  - Go to the class are.na page and look in the 'Performance Mask' channel for the starter template
  - Go to `File->Duplicate` to make a copy of the sketch. (Note that you have to do this intead of just copying the sketch code because there is a modified index.html file as well.)
  - Design a mask that changes when the user speaks.
  - Think of a specific type of performance (mutant opera, cursed hip hop, blessed twee, daytime soaps, tiktok exorcism, anything you can image) and design around this.

#### Before Next Class

- Make a presentation with a minimum of 5 slides proposing your final project.

- We will have 8 minutes to view and discuss each proposal. Your presentation should not take more than 4 minutes so that we have an additional 4 minutes to offer feedback.

- You should propose a realistic and ambitious project that you will be excited to include in your portfolio.

- Your proposal should answer all of these questions:

  1. What is the project?
  2. How does this project build on prior work or interests?
  3.  What is something you are inspired by?
  4. What are the different challenges that you will face in making this project?

- In class, we will be moving quickly. Everyone will take turns screen-sharing and giving their proposal presentations. We will be sequenced in alphabetic order by last name.
